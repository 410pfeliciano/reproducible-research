#Day One overview  
For the first day of the course, we will set up all the needed software. If you took the previous mini-course, you will have most or all of the software needed installed.  

##Needed software
###Python
- Python 2.7.x  
- IPython 3.1.0  
- Jupyter/IPython notebook  
- Anaconda (will install IPython, Jupyter/IPython notebook and SciPy stack) 


###R
- R 3.1.3 or higher  
- RStudio 0.99.441  

##Other dependencies
- Pandoc  
- LaTeX  
- GitHub account
- various Python and R packages for data munging and visualization (see [syllabus](https://github.com/IRCS-analysis-mini-courses/reproducible-research/blob/master/SYLLABUS.md) and [references](https://github.com/IRCS-analysis-mini-courses/reproducible-research/blob/master/REFERENCES.md))

# Notes about file sizes and installation
Several of these programs are very large in size and will take a while to download:  
- Anaconda: 882 MB  
- XCode: need acces to App Store to download  
- RStudio: 315 MB  
- MacTex: 2.5 GB (maybe do this overnight)  
- MikTex: 158 MB + additional packages (maybe do this overnight)

###Suggested
[Julia 0.3.8 and higher](http://julialang.org/) (not needed, but integrates with Jupyter/IPython notebook and is young, but good, language for [numeric analysis and statistics](http://juliastats.github.io/))
