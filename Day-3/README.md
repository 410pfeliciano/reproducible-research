#Day Three

##Overview
The first hour of day three will focus on using the 'Hadleyverse' to import, explore, visualize, summarize, and export data in R; basically, performing Hour 1 of day two in R. Format follows that of day two. The second hour of day three focuses on generating reports (with figures!) with RMarkdown, Sweave and `knitr`.

##Hour 1
- Importing data into R with and without the Hadleyverse  
- `dplyr`: data manipulation, examination/inspection and summarization  
- Exporting data  
- Visualization with base R and `ggplot2`  
- Using `ggplot2` for publication-quality figures  
- Linear regression  
- Logistic regression  
- (Generalized) Linear Mixed Models 
- using reports to share and show your work  

##Hour 2
- output results of Jupyter/IPython notebook (terminal/in notebook)  
    + static HTML  
    + embeddable HTML  
    + articles  
    + reports  
    + HTML slides (Reveal.js)  
    + executable  script (*.py)  
- using R/RStudio to create presentations and reports  
    + HTML slides  
    + R Markdown presentations with Beamer  
    + articles with Sweave / R Markdown / `knitr`
