#Some example datasets for the second day

This directory contains example datasets that you can play around with. This includes not only the Excel spreadsheet that Hadley Wickham includes as part of his `readr` package, but also real experimental data used in the notebook.  

##Notebook datasets
- Psychophysics dataset: dataset from as yet unpublished synthetic vowel discrimination experiment  
- Electrophysiology dataset: dataset from published clinical study; more details [can be found here](http://julian3rd.github.io/chromosomal-mutations-auditory-latency/)  

##Asignment datasets
There are several datasets that are examples of the kinds of summaries you can create using the 2012 FEC US Presidential campaign dataset. You may use these as a guide in order to create different summaries. Also included are plots based off of these summaries.  

The other dataset is from a mutivariate experiment. Try to implement the same manner of analyses and visualizations as in the notebooks. It is a very large dataset (4.3 MB) with 80000 (eighty thousand) rows and data from 100 subjects.  We will review some analyses and results as well as a report prepared from the data on Monday.
