#Day Two

## Overview
Day two will focus on importing, exploring, visualing, summarizing, and exporting data in Python. Modules used include `pandas`, `NumPy`. Depending on the needs, other modules will be used (such as those that can read XML and JSON files and can pull data from databases). The Jupyter/IPython notebook contains details while the HTML slides contain a general overview. The goal is to have a general overview during the lecture and details about manipulating datasets are covered in the notebook to aid in assignments and reading in you own data.  

##Hour 1
The first hour covers basic `pandas` functionality. Topics include:  
- Data format structure  
- Importing data from different formats into a `DataFrame`  
- Examining the structure of the data  
- Basic summaries of the data  
- Visualzing data  
- Exporting cleaned and/or transformed data to a text or other file  

## Hour 2
The second hour covers using the modules `Statsmodels`, `NumPy`, `scikit-learn` and `patsy` to perform basic statistical analyses as well as calling R from the Jupyter/IPython notebook when Python modules are limited in their analysis capabilities. Topics covered:  
- Linear regression  
- Logistic regression  
- (Generalized) Linear Mixed Models  
- R magics in the Jupyter/IPython notebook
