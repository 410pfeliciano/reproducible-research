#Day Four

#Overview

The first hour of day will focus on creating, modifying, and sharing virtual environments via `conda` and `Packrat`. The goal will be to create detailed specfications of packages and dependencies that can be recreated to run code and analysis successfully. The second hour of day four focuses on additional tools in `python`, inlcuding an introudction to `SymPy` focused on symbolic applications in algebra, linear algebra, calculus, with applications to dynamical systems, and the use of curve fitting to explore the fit of mathematical models to data. 


##Hour 1
- `conda` as an environment manager for `python` and more
- Creating environments
- Modifying environments
- Sharing environmnets
- `Packrat` as an environment manager for `R`
- Creating environments
- Modifying environments
- Sharing environments

##Hour 2
- `SymPy`: computer algebra systems
- Symbolic manipulation: algebra, linear algebra, calculus
- Dynamical systems
- Curve fitting
